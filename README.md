# Python-Archicad-Library-Scripts
A library of Python scripts for Archicad using the official API and the Tapir interface.

Work In progress.

## BASIC SCRIPTS
Very basic scripts to understand how to use a command/group of commands. Everything is done in the terminal (official Python interface, Visual Studio Code, OS terminal, etc.).

## WIDGETS
Using certain BASIC scripts, create interfaces with Tkinter to select Archicad elements. These widgets do not trigger actions in Archicad; they serve as a basis for building other scripts.
Use the Tkinter interface because it is integrated into Python and does not require any additional downloads.

## WORKING SCRIPTS
Library of scripts that can be used in Archicad or alongside Archicad
